## INSTALL
This project requires Python and the following Python libraries installed:
* [Numpy](url)
* [Pandas](url)
* [Scilit-learn](url)
* [Seaborn](url)
* [matplotlib](url)
* [Keras](url)
* [mahotas](url)
## DATASETS
* The dataset utilized in this project is sourced from Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prashant268/chest-xray-covid19-pneumonia/data).
* It includes X-ray images of the chest, with training and testing datasets, each containing three subdirectories: ['covid', 'viral pneumonia', 'normal'].

## PROPOSED METHODOLOGY 
The project is divided into total 4 stages: 
* Data Acquisition from online resources 
* Creation of Image Features 
* Comparison between different classification algorithms to achieve maximum accuracy on training data.
* Building and fitting Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

## CODE
It is available in this repository.
