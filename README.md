## INSTALLATION
This project requires Python 
## INTRODUCTION 
* Deepfake technology involves the use of AI/ML to create realistic, manipulated content, often in the form of videos, where a person appears to say or do things they never did. It utilises deep neural networks, such as GANs, to generate convincing simulations that can have implications for misinformation and privacy concerns
* This project involved creating animated videos of still images by capturing the motion of a source video and mapping it onto a target image. I have then used GAN (General Adversarial Networks) to transfer facial expressions or motion patterns between human subjects in videos.  
## CODE
The python file  is already available in the repository.
